# What Is Hey Day?
### On Hey Day, all members of the Auburn family make a special effort to greet one another while walking around campus. Name tags are handed out to facilitate this process, along with fun t-shirts and buttons. This tradition takes place during the fall semester each year, and it originated soon after the end of WWII. The transition back to life in Auburn for veterans who had served during WWII was challenging, so the first Hey Day was organized to help them feel seen, heard, and at home again on campus.
